# FoundAmongTheStars
A GM and player utility for streamlining and enhancing the tabletop game Stars Without Number

This tool is still in the very early stages of development and will feature two modes.
1) "By the book" - the rules as they are written in the official rulebooks
2) "Home rules" - these rules will be presented as options to a GM when setting up a game for the first time or (eventually) in the middle of a game if she decides that some or all of these custom rules improve the game

Currently, the state of the project has the following:

Complete:
A dice rolling function - any size and any number of dice

In progress:
An extensively detailed Navigation check calculator
A homerule Tech/Med healing calculator

Not even started:
A switch for designating which home rules are active
Every other calculated value to have some form of implementation
A GUI
Databasing
Character Sheets
Planet\system Profiles
To Do Lists
Notes - "Captain's logs or otherwise"
GM tools
Linking of software/files within a game (connectivity)
A manual vs. auto-roll mode
